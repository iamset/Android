Question 1: Difference between Activity and Fragment
An activity is a component that provides a user interface for user interaction. While a fragment is a part of an activity. 
An activity can exist independent of a fragment but a fragment is dependent on an activity
An Activity has the following life cycle methods: onCreate, onStart, onResume, onPause, onStop, onRestart, and onDestroy. Conversely, a fragment has the following life cycles methods: onAttach, onCreate, onCreateView, onStart, onResume, onDestroy, onDestroyView, etc.
An activity can contain zero or multiple fragments, while a fragment can be used in multiple activities.
An activity must be mentioned in the manifest file when created, but fragment does not.

Question2: Life cycle of an activity
The life cycle of an activity describes the stages an activity goes through between the time it was created and the time it was destroyed. An activity has 7 lifecycles. They are:
onCreate: This is called when an activity is first created.
onStart: This is called when an activity is becoming visible to the user.
onResume: This is called when a user begins interaction with the activity
onPause: Called when the activity is about to lose focus
onStop:This is called when the activity has lost focus and is no longer visible to the user.
onDestroy: This is called before the activity is destroyed.
